# WifiChat
A simple hotspot chat app for android ( It has bugs, But works ok.)
Written in Eclipse ADT, The Server Should Create a Hotspot before connecting
and then the client may connect to the server through the app and start messaging.
Sorry for the bugs, I Wrote this in 2 hours, and it's my first android project.
